# DYTurbo
Some of the files of the DYTurbo program that I worked with during my research stay on Electroweak corrections to diphoton production. In these files, my work consisted in implementing the contributions corresponding to the real NLO electroweak corrections, together with part of the mixed NNLO corrections.
